# Apache Kafka
[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/) is an open-source distributed event streaming platform that can be 
used either as a message queue or as a stream processing system. Kafka excels 
in delivering high performance, scalability and durability. It's engineered to 
handle vast volumes of data in real time, ensuring no message is ever lost and 
that each piece of data is processed as swiftly as possible.
